    <h4>The Nominative Case</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The nominative case is the base form of the noun and signals the
            subject of the sentence (the person or thing that performs the
            action).{" "}
        </li>
        <li>It is also the word that tells you how to conjugate the verb.</li>
        <li>
            {" "}
            The questions for the nominative case are "Wer?" (Who?) and "Was?"
            (What?){" "}
        </li>
        <li>
            The nominative case is also used after the verbs sein, werden, and
            bleiben. (Warning: Here it is NOT the subject!)
        </li>
    </ul>
